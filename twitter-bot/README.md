Things we agreed:

- Establish more formal processes including:
- Daily "retro" (i.e. short review of today's code)
- Code reviews
- Removing ability to push directly to master branch
- Testing (front end & API)


## Thursday planning session  

The second two day sprint focused on the following user stories:

> As a user  
> So I know what's going on in the world  
> I can see a list of top hashtags on the landing page  

> As a group member  
> So I know the API data is being handled correctly  
> All the JS API functions are fully tested
